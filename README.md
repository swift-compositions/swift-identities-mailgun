A Swift package that provides Mailgun email integration for [swift-identities](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-identities) authentication system.

## Overview

This package bridges the gap between swift-identities authentication system and Mailgun email service, providing ready-to-use email templates for all identity-related communications.

## Features

- Email verification with 24-hour expiration
- Password reset and change notifications
- Email address change confirmations
- Account deletion notifications
- Multi-language support (Dutch/English)
- Type-safe HTML templates via swift-html
- Dependency injection via swift-dependencies

## Installation

Add this package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-identities-mailgun", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Add the product to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "IdentitiesMailgun", package: "swift-identities-mailgun")
    ]
)
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup with Live Mailgun

```swift
import IdentitiesMailgunLive
import Dependencies
import ServerFoundation

// Configure your business details
let business = BusinessDetails(
    name: "MyApp",
    supportEmail: try EmailAddress("support@myapp.com"),
    fromEmail: try EmailAddress("noreply@myapp.com")
)

// Create the email configuration with Mailgun integration
let emailConfig = Identity.Backend.Configuration.Email.mailgun(
    business: business,
    router: identityRouter
)

// Use in your Identity.Backend.Configuration or Identity.Standalone.Configuration
```

### Development/Testing with Logging

For local development without sending actual emails:

```swift
let emailConfig = Identity.Backend.Configuration.Email.mailgunLogging(
    business: business,
    router: identityRouter
)
// This will log all email operations without sending emails
```

### Custom Email Sending

If you need more control over the email sending process:

```swift
let emailConfig = Identity.Backend.Configuration.Email.mailgun(
    business: business,
    router: identityRouter,
    sendEmail: { request in
        // Custom email sending logic
        try await myCustomMailgunClient.send(request)
    }
)
```

## Email Templates

All email templates are built using type-safe HTML DSL from swift-html and include professional, responsive design with multi-language support, clear call-to-action buttons, security notices, and support contact information.

### Available Templates

#### Email Verification
- Sent when a new user registers
- Contains verification link
- 24-hour expiration notice

#### Password Reset

- Change notification for security

#### Email Change
